# Truth-Table-Generator
The program will give a truth table for any propositional logic formula

For input, it doesn't take Greek symbols. So instead, please write Plain English ('not' , 'and', 'or', 'implies')
For example, ((((p and q) or r) implies (r and p)) implies (not (p and r)))

The project uses the module 'tabulate' to make a table from the data
so use "pip3 install tabulate" to install the module
